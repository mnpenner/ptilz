# Ptilz #

A collection of general-purpose PHP utility methods.

Ptilz is currently pre-1.0 and as such should be considered to have an unstable API. Be prepared for things to be refactored without warning.

I aim to provide full test coverage of every function, but I'm not quite there yet.

Most functions have doc-comments; read them! If usage still isn't clear check out the unit tests in the `tests/` folder.

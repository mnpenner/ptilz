# Ptilz #

A collection of general-purpose PHP utility methods.

Ptilz is currently pre-1.0 and as such should be considered to have an unstable API. However, it is used in a few production
projects now, so I will try not to release any breaking changes -- particularly anything with a unit test should be stable.
However, I will likely delete any deprecated methods before releasing 1.0.

Most methods should work on Windows, Ubuntu and FreeBSD.

I aim to provide full test coverage of every function, but I'm not quite there yet.

Most functions have doc-comments; read them! If usage still isn't clear check out the unit tests in the `tests/` folder.

## Issues

Please report them on [the issue tracker](https://github.com/mnpenner/ptilz/issues).

## Contributing

Please open a ticket and just paste in the code you wanted, preferably with a few unit tests too. I will add it in if I think it makes sense.
